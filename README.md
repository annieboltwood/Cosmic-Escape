# Cosmic Escape
“Cosmic Escape” is a game involving an astronaut named Jerry, on his space journey back home to the International Space Station (ISS). In Jerry’s way are different obstacles impeding him from going back. Firstly, deadly giant aliens of the Waru clan are resting throughout space, who are so powerful that they damage any spaceship that bumps into them. Secondly, there are also flying meteors that Jerry must avoid, otherwise his ship will completely tear apart into dust. Lastly, there is a final hurdle for Jerry, that is the lazy Waru Clan Aliens, have put 4 barriers of different color around the ISS, 
that can only be unlocked by keys of matching color, which are scattered throughout space. If that wasn’t enough, Jerry's journey only gets harder with 
stationary rocks around the map that Jerry must navigate around, although not damaging, make the travel lengthier. 
In spite of the perils, scattered around the map are the different keys that Jerry can use to get past the barriers blocking the ISS. 
Furthermore, the keys upon retrieval also boost the Spaceship's score, ensuring further protection against the giant aliens. 
There are also different balls of energy appearing sporadically around the map that boost the Spaceship's score further.
